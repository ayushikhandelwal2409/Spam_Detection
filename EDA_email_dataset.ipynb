a sprained foot he suffered the injury in indianapolis' previous game against the patriots terrence wilkins or reggie wayne will start in his place consider reserving pathon this week ty detmer qb det free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber detmer was benched on monday night after another poor outing he was replaced by charlie batch and may have lost his starting qb spot in any event neither signal caller has much fantasy value kevan barlow rb sf grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber barlow is still being hampered by a quadriceps injury but will continue to play despite the ailment it happened what two months ago and it probably won't heal until the offseason i just have to work through it barlow told the san francisco chronicle people don't know how bad this is hurting the injury could hamper barlow's playing time in the future so be cautious when starting him fantasy wise j j stokes wr sf uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber stokes who injured his knee during sunday's win over carolina is listed as probable for this weekend's contest at atlanta he's been inconsistent thus far and shouldn't be depended on to produce fantasy wise duce staley rb phi luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber according to head coach andy reid staley's shoulder injury will not cost him the starting rb spot however he did say that staley will be eased back into the role after the team's bye week so expect correll buckhalter to see the majority of the carries when philly plays the n y giants on october escapenumber bubba franks te gb president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber franks suffered a slight knee injury during sunday's loss to tampa bay the injury isn't considered serious however and franks is expected to start this weekend against baltimore raghib ismail wr dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ismail knee will work into drills this week which means that there is a possibility that he will return for monday's game against washington even if he does return he's not worth starting for a fantasy perspective jackie harris te dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber harris who has been struggling with a groin injury is expected to participate in drills this week he'll likely be available for monday's game against washington barring any setbacks anthony wright qb dal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber with quincy carter out for two weeks wright will be dallas' starting qb for at least next week's game you may actually want to consider starting wright this week against washington but you'd have to be pretty desperate quincy carter qb dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber carter is now expected to miss four to six weeks due to a hamstring injury anthony wright will start in carter's place but neither qb has much fantasy value at this point fred baxter te chi free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber baxter hip who was inactive for sunday's game against atlanta could be out for this weekend's game as well the veteran tight end has very little value as a fantasy player at this point so the injury won't make a huge impact james allen rb chi texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber allen will remain the bears' no escapenumber tailback at least for the moment rookie anthony thomas will see an increase in playing time however so allen's fantasy value will likely take a hit anthony thomas rb chi president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber according to the chicago sun times thomas will not take over the starting rb spot in chicago at least not yet head coach dick jaroun will stick with current no escapenumber tailback james allen for the time being but thomas will see an increase in playing time and is worth picking up fantasy wise redskins dt was free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber defensive end bruce smith who was knocked out of sunday's game against the giants with a dislocated right shoulder will miss two to three weeks while the tissue in his right shoulder heals and he regains his strength and range of motion you shouldn't be using the redskins' defense on a weekly basis in a fantasy league to begin with keyshawn johnson wr tb orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson suffered a shoulder contusion when it was driven into the ground during the fourth quarter of sunday's game against green bay he should be fine for week five but see how he fares in practice before making a decision on starting him next week tiki barber rb nyg team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the giants said that barber should be able to return from a hamstring injury next sunday in st louis however it is unclear whether he will get the majority of the carries over ron dayne so be careful starting either unless the giants' rb picture clears up by then ron dayne rb nyg texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber dayne left sunday's game against washington with a neck stinger an injury which the giants said was not serious he should be able to play next sunday in st louis corey bradford wr gb luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber bradford left sunday's game in tampa bay with cramps after returning a kickoff he will be re evaluated on monday ryan leaf qb tb free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber the cowboys remain interest in leaf despite ligament damage in his wrist according to the fort worth star telegram they may sign him to the roster and place him on injured reserve leaf offers no fantasy value at this stage of his career quincy carter qb dal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber carter said the next escapenumber hours would determine whether he will be able to play a week from monday against washington according to the dallas morning news he has a strained left hamstring that he said he felt pop during the first quarter of sunday's game carter isn't a recommended fantasy starter even when healthy matt hasselbeck qb sea texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber hasselbeck groin missed seattle's win over jacksonville and watched trent dilfer lead the team to escapenumber points still mike holmgren claimed the injured hasselbeck will remain seattle's starter i said it before and i'll say it again holmgren told the seattle times matt hasselbeck is our quarterback hasselbeck's status for seattle's next game is unclear laveranues coles wr nyj team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber coles sprained his ankle at buffalo the injury is not considered to be serious terry glenn wr ne luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber glenn is eligible to start practicing but the patriots have applied for a roster exemption so he can get into playing shape don't expect him to be a solid contributor to the new england passing game in the near future when he will make his return to the lineup is still unclear ray lucas qb mia c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber lucas appeared in short yardage sets on sunday he still won't play often enough to affect jay fiedler's numbers kevin kasper wr den texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber kasper suffered a severely sprained right ankle on sunday and will miss three to six weeks travis mcgriff or chris cole might see more time in the passing game while kasper is out rickey dudley te cle team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber dudley played with a sprained foot on sunday he is not expected to miss any playing time patrick johnson wr bal free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson is expected to miss eight weeks with a clavicle injury he had already started to fall behind the emerging travis taylor as a preferred target in the passing game chris weinke qb car houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber weinke was extremely ineffective against the niners sunday he completed only escapenumber of escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards three of his incompletions resulted in interceptions while he threw only one touchdown pass weinke was effective in the season opener but has proven to be a fantasy reserve at best wesley walls te car team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber walls proved to be quarterback chris weinke's best target sunday against the escapenumberers catching escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards and a score walls won't do this every week but he will get a lot of looks from weinke when he can't find his receivers terrell owens wr sf team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber owens was productive once again on sunday catching eight passes for escapenumber yards and two scores look for him to do well next week against atlanta garrison hearst rb sf really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber hearst did not score but provided decent production sunday against the panthers gaining escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries he is not starter material at this point but will be a good backup in most fantasy leagues jeff garcia qb sf c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber garcia was solid once again in sunday's game against the panthers he threw for escapenumber yards and two touchdown passes against only one interception aaron brooks qb no grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brooks turned in his second consecutive mediocre performance sunday he only threw for escapenumber yards with an interception and no touchdown passes brooks has struggled in the last two games but the saints will stick with him as the starter since they are winning games michael vick qb atl really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber vick was an adequate replacement for the injured chris chandler but he failed to lead the falcons to the end zone he completed escapenumber of escapenumber passes for escapenumber yards and also gained escapenumber yards on four carries look for vick to return to the bench next week patrick jeffers wr car c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jeffers knees missed sunday's game against san francisco he continues to make progress in his recovery from multiple knee surgeries but isn't ready to return to action just yet kevan barlow rb sf grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber barlow recently revealed that he is playing with a quadriceps injury that has hampered his ability since training camp it happened what two months ago and it probably won't heal until the offseason i just have to work through it barlow told the san francisco chronicle people don't know how bad this is hurting barlow will continue to play but the injury might prevent him from taking over as the full time running back keep him on your bench for now shawn jefferson wr atl free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jefferson missed most of the second half of sunday's game due to neck and back injuries he will be evaluated on a daily basis receivers terance mathis brian finneran and quentin mccord will be the wideouts next week if he is inactive nick goings rb car texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber goings was inactive for sunday's game as tim biakabutuka resumed his job as the starting running back keep goings on your bench for now tim biakabutuka rb car c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber biakabutuka started sunday's game after being benched a week earlier he wasn't too effective gaining escapenumber yards on escapenumber rushes biakabutuka also caught two passes for escapenumber yards keep biakabutuka on your bench if you have depth at running back chris chandler qb atl orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber chandler left sunday's game after suffering a concussion the injury was diagnosed as a grade escapenumber concussion the least severe on the scale he is listed as day to day michael vick will start next sunday if he is unable to play j j stokes wr sf uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber stokes sprained his knee in sunday's game but stayed in the contest he will be evaluated on a daily basis stokes had just one catch in the game for six yards laveranues coles wr nyj team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber coles caught five passes for escapenumber yards and carried the ball two times for escapenumber yards at buffalo coles has apparently become an important part of the new york offense in his second pro season anthony becht te nyj free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber becht caught three passes for escapenumber yards and a td at buffalo despite some early struggles becht still appears to be an key member of the new york passing game on third downs and near the goal line peerless price wr buf drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber price caught four passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the jets don't expect big numbers from price again in the near future he very rarely breaks loose for a big play the escapenumber yard td pass he caught in week four is not one of his usual feats travis henry rb buf c dawg's boyz updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber henry rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against the jets against low quality defenses that appear on the schedule henry should continue to be a good fantasy option keenan mccardell wr jac uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mccardell caught seven passes for escapenumber yards at seattle the veteran wideout looks to be in good health again and should be a solid fantasy starter for the rest of the year itula mili te sea free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mili caught two passes for escapenumber yards and a td against jacksonville mili is quick and has good hands he is worth a look if you need help at the tight end position shaun alexander rb sea houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber alexander rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries and scored two tds against jacksonville he will continue to be a good fantasy starter while ricky watters is out and alexander seems to be more of a td threat than watters can be right now stacey mack rb jac drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mack was benched at seattle on sunday in the second quarter after rushing for only escapenumber yards on eight carries on his final attempt of the day he lost a fumble and was replaced by rookie elvis joseph the first year back rushed for only escapenumber yards and fumbled as well but he caught an escapenumber yard td pass now there will be major questions as to who will start the next game at rb for the jaguars if fred taylor is not ready to return from a groin injury after the bye week tyrone wheatley rb oak uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wheatley scored two tds against dallas on sunday his rushing totals escapenumber yards were modest however and it's still tough to start him on a weekly basis due to the presence of charlie garner tim brown wr oak uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brown caught seven passes for escapenumber yards in oakland's win over dallas he continues to be one of the more consistent receivers in the league from a fantasy perspective joey galloway wr dal team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber dallas tried to open up their offense against oakland and galloway's numbers improved slightly as a result he had his best game of the season posting escapenumber yards receiving and a td those are modest numbers however so don't think of starting him on a weekly basis aaron stecker rb tb president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber stecker rushed for only six yards on two carries against green bay he does not appear to be a viable option for the buccaneers while warrick dunn is out tampa bay apparently still has faith in mike alstott emmitt smith rb dal team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith was held in check once again posting only escapenumber yards of total offense against oakland without an effective passing game smith is going to have a long season anthony wright qb dal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wright took over at qb for dallas after quincy carter left in the first quarter with a strained hamstring he completed escapenumber of escapenumber for escapenumber yards and two tds against oakland but still has very little value as a fantasy player mike alstott rb tb luccis losers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber alstott rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries and a td against the packers the big fullback proved he can still be a dependable fantasy rb frank wycheck te ten drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber wycheck left sunday's game against baltimore with a neck strain he did not return to the game and will be re evaluated on monday antonio freeman wr gb drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber freeman caught only one pass for six yards at tampa bay with the emergence of bill schroeder freeman has become the less desirable option of green bay's starting wideouts olandis gary rb den houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber gary carried the ball only nine times for escapenumber yards in denver's escapenumber escapenumber win over kansas city he may have slipped to no escapenumber on the depth chart behind mike anderson mike anderson rb den really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber anderson posted escapenumber yards rushing and a score against kansas city on sunday he received much more of the workload in the denver backfield than olandis gary and may be emerging as the team's no escapenumber back bill schroeder wr gb grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber schroeder caught four passes for escapenumber yards and a td at tampa bay the green bay wideout performed well against a very tough defense proving he has indeed become a quality fantasy player rod smith wr den blue balls updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith had another huge outing posting eight receptions for escapenumber yards and a score against kansas city smith is establishing himself as one of the best wideouts in the league this season and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis brian griese qb den really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber griese struggled for the second consecutive week posting only escapenumber yards passing and a td against kansas city griese's numbers are being hurt somewhat by the loss of ed mccaffrey but he still warrants a weekly starting spot in most leagues fantasy wise priest holmes rb kc houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber holmes put up decent numbers against denver posting seven receptions and escapenumber yards of total offense he's not worthy of a starting spot every week but he could be useful when the matchup is right trent

defense and was held without a td pass in the chiefs' escapenumber escapenumber loss keyshawn johnson wr tb orange roughy updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber johnson left sunday's game vs green bay for a brief period in the third quarter with an apparent shoulder injury he returned to the game after an examination on the sidelines maurice smith rb atl dont mess updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against the bears smith lacks the speed and burst to be a solid fantasy rb for the rest of the year don't count on him as anything more than a reserve despite the respectable look of his final week four numbers marcus robinson wr chi president taft updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber robinson caught nine passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the falcons robinson has reclaimed his spot among fantasy football's top wideouts now that he is healthy again martay jenkins wr ari free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber jenkins caught six passes for escapenumber yards and a td against the eagles don't expect such totals from jenkins on a regular basis he might draw more defensive attention in the coming weeks and has never proved he can put up good numbers in the past todd pinkston wr phi drock's beaatchs updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber pinkston caught four passes for escapenumber yards and two tds against the cardinals the young wideout has quickly emerged as a quality fantasy player because of his good hands concentration and leaping ability correll buckhalter rb phi uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber buckhalter rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against arizona the rookie has put up fine yardage numbers in his pair of starts in place of the injured duce staley jake plummer qb ari really rottens updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber plummer threw for escapenumber yards two tds and an interception in a win over philadelphia his respectable performance against the eagles' strong defense should convince many fantasy owners to take a chance on him as a backup jay fiedler qb mia c

numbers on a weekly basis james mcknight wr mia free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber mcknight caught two passes for just escapenumber yards against the patriots the veteran wideout cannot be counted on for reliable fantasy production troy brown wr ne houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brown caught five passes for escapenumber yards at

the rookie posted five receptions for escapenumber yards in the game antowain smith rb ne team dick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber smith rushed for escapenumber yards and a td at miami while he may not post consistently good yardage numbers the rest of the year smith will continue to be a td threat rob johnson qb buf grid iron goons updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber

escapenumber escapenumber taylor had his second consecutive good outing on sunday posting five receptions and a touchdown in baltimore's escapenumber escapenumber victory over tennessee if he

four passes for just escapenumber yards against the steelers jon kitna has been working more exclusively with darnay scott and warrick hasn't put up good fantasy numbers yet this season jason brookins rb bal houston big ballers updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber brookins saw an increase in his carries on sunday against tennessee and his numbers really reflected it he posted escapenumber yards and a touchdown in baltimore's escapenumber escapenumber victory and could see more playing time in the ravens' offense from now on hines ward wr pit team chick updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber ward caught eight passes escapenumber yards against the bengals he continues to be pittsburgh's only reliable wide receiver and now qualifies as a solid fantasy reserve terry allen rb bal texas terminators updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber allen finally had a productive game posting escapenumber yards rushing and a touchdown against tennessee however he still isn't a player that fantasy owners should depend on for consistent production erron kinney te ten free agent updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber kinney had a solid game against baltimore posting seven catches for escapenumber yards he is putting a dent into frank wycheck's numbers early in the year and will likely play a more prominent role in the titans' offense this season jerome bettis rb pit blue balls updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber bettis rushed for escapenumber yards on escapenumber carries against cincinnati he will continue to stack up good numbers from a yardage perspective but the pittsburgh offense is not giving him enough scoring opportunities ricky williams rb no uran man updated escapenumber escapenumber escapenumber despite a slight shoulder injury

trading company continued its merger talks with rival dynegy inc . dynegy , an independent power producer and utility owner , is looking at acquiring enron for roughly $ 7 billion to $ 8 billion , people familiar with the talks say . however , those talks could also be influenced by whether enron is further downgraded by major credit - ratings agencies .\nthe total price being discussed would equate to about $ 10 an enron share , barely above where the stock is currently trading and far below the level of even two weeks ago . as of 4 p . m . in new york stock exchange composite trading yesterday , enron shares were down 7 . 1 % , or 64 cents , to $ 8 . 41 , a tenth of their 52 - week high of $ 84 . 875 .\non the big board , dynegy traded at $ 36 . 50 , up $ 3 . 50 . shares of several energy - trading companies were up yesterday following a directive from federal regulators that the california state government pay an estimated $ 1 . 6 billion for past power purchases .\nin yesterday ' s sec filing , enron also made major adjustments in its reported assets , debt and shareholder equity back to 1997 . for instance , for the three - month period ended sept . 30 , enron lopped about $ 2 . 2 billion , or 19 % , off shareholder equity , reducing it to a total of $ 9 . 5 billion . previously , the company had disclosed a reduction of only $ 1 . 2 billion .\nthe filing also said that enron discharged ben glisan , the company treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of enron ' s north america unit , in connection with investments they made in one of the officer - run limited partnerships . until yesterday , enron had insisted that mr . glisan wasn ' t associated with the officer - run partnerships . the company wouldn ' t explain why the the two had been discharged , and mr . glisan and ms . mordaunt couldn ' t be reached to comment .\nthe sec filing is the latest chapter in a crisis that has engulfed the nation ' s biggest energy - trading company during the past month . during that time , enron has reported a big third - quarter loss , the replacement of its chief financial officer who ran two of the controversial partnerships , and an sec investigation .\nthe sec filing raises further questions about enron ' s accounting procedures and disclosure policies . concerns over these matters are vexing investors and analysts , including those at major credit - rating agencies . the agencies downgraded enron debt during recent weeks and have the company on review for further downgrades .\nralph pellecchia , credit analyst for fitch , said he couldn ' t predict what effect the sec filing would have on enron ' s credit rating , but he added that the document contained damaging disclosures . \" it ' s bad , \" he said .\nthe enron sec filing also raises questions about the conduct of its outside auditor , arthur andersen llp , which reviewed the company ' s annual financial statements and certified them as consistent with accepted accounting principals . because of all the accounting adjustments \" the audit reports covering the year - end financial statements for 1997 - 2000 should not be relied upon , \" yesterday ' s sec filing said .\nan andersen spokesman called enron ' s restatement announcement \" an unfortunate situation \" but said the accounting firm is \" cooperating with the company . . . to bring resolution to these matters . \" he said he couldn ' t comment further because of client - confidentiality concerns .\namong the accounting turnabouts , enron said it had improperly accounted for two partnerships connected to michael\nkopper , a former managing director of the company ' s north america unit . the two partnerships were known as joint energy development investments lp , or jedi , and chewco investments lp .\nas reported , mr . kopper managed the general partner of chewco , which was formed in 1997 . jedi had been formed in 1993 by enron in partnership with the huge california public employees ' retirement system , or calpers .\nin 1997 enron , which operated jedi , bought out calpers ' interest for $ 383 million and immediately sold it to chewco , according to the sec filing . almost all the money for chewco ' s purchase came in loans from jedi and an unnamed financial institution , whose loan was guaranteed by enron .\nby having a supposed outside party in the form of chewco as a partner , enron treated jedi as an unconsolidated affiliate and kept hundreds of millions of dollars of partnership debt off its balance sheet . enron now acknowledges that treatment was wrong and that both jedi and chewco should have been consolidated starting in 1997 . taking that step retroactively resulted in a $ 396 million reduction in net income for the years 1997 to 2000 , the sec filing said .\nmr . kopper , who left enron in july to run the partnerships , didn ' t return a phone call seeking comment . in the past , he has declined to be interviewed .\nenron also retroactively consolidated some of the results of its dealings with a partnership called ljm cayman lp . that consolidation reduced 1999 and 2000 net income by $ 103 million .\nljm and a similar but much larger partnership , called ljm 2 co - investment lp , were formed in 1999 by enron ' s then - chief financial officer andrew fastow , who was replaced last month . the two partnerships were run by mr . fastow and mr . kopper , according to the enron sec filing and private partnership documents . enron ' s sec filing said the company believes that mr . fastow sold his interests in the ljm partnerships in july to mr . kopper . mr . fastow has declined to be interviewed .\nseveral analysts said they were troubled that none of the earnings restatements were directly attributed to the much larger ljm 2 partnership . some also pointed to a sentence in the sec filing that said \" it is possible \" that continuing enron reviews will \" identify additional or different information concerning these matters . \"\nas such , \" there remains doubt about whether there is something else in the closet , \" said brian youngberg , energy analyst at edward jones in st . louis .\nthe enron sec filing gave new information about the effect on company earnings of transactions related to the ljm partnerships . since 1999 , those transactions produced $ 577 . 8 million in pretax earnings , despite a $ 711 million pretax charge in this year ' s third quarter due to the termination of deals with several ljm 2 - related entities . the filing also estimated that mr . fastow received more than $ 30 million from the ljm partnerships .\n- - - mea culpa\nin the midst of talks to be acquired by dynegy , enron details\naccounting and other actions .\n- -

' '\nthat excellent advice was not issued by enron management , although it should have been . instead it came more than 30 years ago from john n . mitchell , president richard m . nixon ' s attorney general .\nenron ' s restatement of earnings yesterday did not go far enough to allow investors to understand all of what went on during the company ' s many strange transactions with related parties . it is now consolidating the results of some of its off - balance - sheet creations , though what happened in the most important ones remains a mystery .\nbut the restatement should , at the least , cause investors and wall street analysts to realize they have been fooled by so - called pro forma earnings , which leave out unpleasant realities and ignore accounting rules .\nin january , enron told investors its ' ' recurring net income , ' ' as it calls its pro forma number , would be $ 1 . 70 to $ 1 . 75 a share this year . the company ' s share price rose to $ 82 when that forecast was made .\nremarkably , enron is still on course to hit that target . yesterday ' s restatement raised its nine - month earnings figure by a penny , to $ 1 . 36 . and yet enron appears to be willing to sell out for about $ 10 a share , or less than six times its reported profits , which still appear to be growing . why so little ?\nthe answer may be that enron ' s board knows those numbers are not reliable measures of performance . enron ' s failure to disclose more about the still unconsolidated subsidiaries is an indication that the unreleased facts would not be reassuring . and enron cannot stay in business unless customers and investors believe it is financially solid . so it is willing to sell out for a fraction of what it appeared to be worth only weeks ago . don ' t call it a takeover . takeunder would be a better term .\nwhat set off enron ' s collapse ? it now appears to have been a mistake . enron says it added $ 1 billion to shareholder equity in 2000 and early this year in error . the mistake did nothing to improve enron ' s profits at the time , so it seems unlikely it was deliberate . had the mistake not been made , the reduction in shareholder equity it disclosed last month would have been $ 200 million , not $ 1 . 2 billion . that reduction scared investors into believing that enron ' s transactions with partnerships led by andrew fastow , its former chief financial officer , had been disastrous for the company . now it appears they may not have been so bad .\nbut that fact is not very important now . enron ' s new disclosures indicate that perhaps 40 percent of its reported profits in 2000 came from dealings with the fastow partnerships . such profits may be legal under accounting rules , but there are good reasons to doubt how real they are .\nin fact , the accounting rule makers are even now pondering a question that may be important to enron . the body charged with dealing with new accounting issues got a rush question on oct . 23 - - the day before enron ousted mr . fastow - - about the accounting on transactions at a hypothetical ' ' big energy corporation ' ' where one subsidiary , a natural gas pipeline company , trades with another subsidiary , an energy trading entity . the question posed was whether a company can report profits made by one subsidiary while ignoring the losses of the other one . that company may or may not be enron .\nsuch games will not work anymore , at least for enron . it needs to be acquired because its customers are not willing to believe even its revised numbers .\ngraph shows enron share prices since oct . 15 .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones section c\nsurest steps , not the swiftest , are propelling dynegy past enron\nby neela banerjee\n11 / 09 / 2001\nthe new york times\npage 5 , column 1\nc . 2001 new york times company\nthe tortoise appears ready to overtake the hare .\nuntil they confirmed yesterday that they were in merger talks , the enron corporation and dynegy inc . were rivals within the new , rapidly evolving deregulated power industry . each embodied a sharply different approach to making money , attracting investors and winning over regulators .\nenron thrived on risk , hurling itself into projects and businesses largely untested by others , earning along the way a reputation for innovation and the acclaim of the investors and analysts who now so angrily shun it because of its murky accounting .\ndynegy is the slower , more cautious company , the younger sibling that carefully gleaned lessons from the example set by a brasher enron . dynegy ' s steady progress has now made it strong and solvent enough to contemplate a multibillion - dollar takeover of its erstwhile competitor .\nas one senior energy industry executive said , ' ' enron ' s trying to hit more triples and home runs , while dynegy tries for singles and doubles . ' '\nkenneth lay , the enron chairman and chief executive who built an empire from two troubled gas pipeline companies - - and whose influential friends include president bush - - is the one who points to the bleachers . dynegy ' s chairman and chief executive , charles l . watson , is less well known but is well respected among stock analysts . he also started small , nurturing his energy trading and generating company - - which had $ 33 billion in revenue for the nine months ended sept . 30 - - from a natural gas trading concern he began in the mid - 80 ' s .\nwhen electricity markets around the united states were deregulated , the companies followed clearly divergent paths . utilities no longer necessarily generated power , and they and their larger industrial clients looked for good deals on the power being sold on the new wholesale markets for electricity . enron and dynegy traded and marketed energy . yet enron sold most of the power plants it owned and focused mainly on financial transactions rather than the actual physical delivery of power , a strategy that made the company a lot of money very fast .\ndynegy bought power plants instead and focused on being a reliable supplier of energy . it cashed in , too , on deregulation , but not as enron had . it stuck to its core energy business as its archrival branched into overseas operations , retail power marketing , a water business and a broadband venture , most of which have gone badly awry .\nmr . watson said in an interview earlier this year that a string of power plant acquisitions had kept his company diversified and balanced . ' ' we need a little bit everywhere , ' ' he said . ' ' enron is a financial player , but dynegy is more of a physical player . ' '\nif enron ' s finances grew more confusing , dynegy seemed to offer clarity . if enron promised a lot , analysts said , dynegy played up its accomplishments . enron lobbied regulators and politicians very publicly , while dynegy kept things quiet and discreet .\n' ' chuck watson is a pretty straight - talking guy , ' ' said christopher r . ellinghaus , a williams capital group analyst .\nbecause enron had such extravagant earnings promises to fulfill , some analysts said , it may have been tempted to hide its problems and losses with creative accounting . while dynegy avoided such a path , no one really expects mr . watson to gloat about his company ' s new , larger stature . enron may have been less a hare than a canary in the deregulation coal mine , and it is unclear who will take on that role now .\n' ' dynegy had what could be called a second - mover advantage , ' ' said andre meade , head of commerzbank securities ' united states utility research . ' ' it seemed to be content to watch its larger rival up the street in houston , enron , go into a market . and if it was successful , dynegy then could go in with less money and make it work .

' ' however , the effective industry bailout that the merger would represent would probably lead to some leniency from the f . t . c . , and would probably be looked at with some relief by the f . e . r . c . ' '\nit was clear yesterday there would be opposition to the deal . ' ' if dynegy and enron were to get together , obviously the thing that would appeal to dynegy would be to combine the trading function of the two entities , and that in itself would provide greater market power , not less market power , ' ' said raymond plank , chairman of the apache corporation , one of the largest independent natural gas producers , based in houston .\nmr . plank said he hoped regulators would take a critical look at any deal . ' ' the thing they should take a look at is the concentration of market power that has led to excessive volatility , and as a result , once again is threatening north american gas producers . ' '\nenron ' s restated profits almost wiped out its net income in 1997 , and reduced it for every year since . but the changes actually raised its reported profits so far this year by $ 5 million .\nthe changes came largely from including results of two special purpose partnerships that it had treated as being independent - - companies called jedi and chewco , after characters in the ' ' star wars ' ' movies - - and of including a subsidiary of a partnership called ljml . that partnership , and another called ljm 2 , were run by mr . fastow .\nthe remainder of the earnings reductions , totaling $ 92 million from 1997 through 2000 , came from what enron called ' ' prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications , ' ' which appear to have been changes previously recommended by arthur andersen , enron ' s auditors , but not made because the auditors were persuaded the amounts were immaterial . details of those charges were not disclosed , and enron said it might further alter its reporting as a special board committee continues its investigation of the partnership transactions .\n' ' this is an unfortunate situation , ' ' said david tabolt , a spokesman for arthur andersen , which audited enron ' s books in all the years in question . ' ' issues have surfaced that have caused the company to restate its financial statements and advise investors that they should not rely on enron ' s financial statements or our audit reports . we are cooperating with the company and its special committee to bring resolution to these matters . ' '\nwhile the restated financial statements consolidated the results of two partnerships and the ljml subsidiary , they did not fold the entire ljml partnership or the ljm 2 partnership into enron ' s financials . it is not clear how those partnerships performed . nor did they include some other related entities whose enron - guaranteed debts have aroused concern among investors .\nmr . fastow , enron ' s former chief financial officer , could not be reached for comment , his lawyer said .\nenron ' s downward cascade began after it reported third - quarter earnings on oct . 16 . its share price rose 67 cents , to $ 33 . 84 , that day , as the company said its ' ' recurring net income ' ' had met analyst expectations , even though write - offs led to a net loss .\nin a conference call that day , kenneth l . lay , enron ' s chairman , mentioned that the company had written down shareholder equity by $ 1 . 2 billion as it closed out its relationships with the ljm partnerships . in the following days , that figure became widely discussed as some investors concluded that the company had suffered a large loss that it was able to avoid reporting on the earnings statement .\nbut enron said yesterday that reduction should have been only $ 200 million , with the remaining $ 1 billion reduction simply reversing prior errors made in 2000 and early this year .\nenron said it had set up procedures to monitor transactions with the ljm partnerships and assure they were proper . ' ' whether these controls were properly implemented ' ' is being investigated by the special board committee , the company said . that committee has retained william mclucas , a former director of enforcement for the s . e . c . , as well as accountants from deloitte kristina mordaunt , the general counsel of an enron division ; and kathy lynn , vice president of an enron division . the company said ms . lynn no longer worked for enron and that the company was ' ' terminating the employment ' ' of the other two .\nsome industry officials said yesterday that a deal with dynegy was increasingly looking like a do - or - die prospect for enron , as other energy - trading companies began to back away from the company and take their business to other trading companies . while enron has a large network of natural gas pipelines and other profitable assets , by far its most valuable franchise is its energy - trading business in north america , which acts as an intermediary in more gas and electricity trades than any other company .\nyesterday , volume in that business dropped 20 percent . an enron spokesman said company traders attributed the drop to concerns about the s . e . c . investigation and the outcome of the merger talks with dynegy .\nenron also canceled a planned meeting with its creditors today in houston , executives said . the agenda for the meeting had been an extension of its $ 3 billion credit lines , but the merger talks superseded that discussion .\nphoto : dynegy ' s chief executive , charles l . watson , is respected among stock analysts .

billion question . bearish stock markets are the indispensable scavengers of capitalism . they clean up the financial and economic landscape and kill off disease - carrying pests . true believers in free markets should rejoice when bears rush in after a prolonged period of misbehaviour has fouled the financial environment .\nthose of us who thought the energy industry would escape the great technology bear market may have been too complacent . in recent weeks , the biggest loser on the new york stock exchange has not been a tech stock , but enron , a component of the dow jones utilities index . enron ' s high was $ 89 . 06 a share , and as recently as august it was trading at $ 45 . in recent weeks , enron ' s shares have plunged , closing last week below $ 12 . 33 that collapse has sent shock waves through the capital markets . what may be even more significant for energy producers and users is the valuation of enron ' s bonds : they are trading at distressed prices , offering yields comparable to junk bonds . the ratings services have turned highly negative on enron , although they still rate it an investment - grade credit .\n( i regret - - oh how i regret ! - - that i must disclose before proceeding further that investment funds i manage have , at this writing , exposure to enron stock , acquired at prices substantially above current markets . )\nfor canadians unfamiliar with enron and its place in u . s . energy markets , here is an introduction : voltaire summed up the entire 18 th - century deistic proof of the existence of god by saying , \" if god did not exist , it would be necessary to invent him . \" it ' s the same with enron . u . s . energy markets needed a prime mover . prior to enron , these markets ( other than crude oil ) were relatively primitive and inefficient . neither producers nor consumers had means to hedge their risks effectively , and long - term contracts were made - - if at all - - under circumstances of grossly inadequate information .\nthe futures market for natural gas was spotty and unreliable , and no futures market for electricity existed . enter enron . in the past half - dozen years , enron became the greatest trading house for energy in the world . its willingness to make markets in energy futures in almost any amount transformed the markets for electric power and gave natural gas producers and consumers reliable hedging and financing opportunities , day in , day out .\nby putting its own capital on the line to make trades , enron created depth , liquidity and transparency in energy markets . so active were those markets that they gave price signals to all who would follow them . conspicuous among those who didn ' t were the policy - makers in california . had gov . gray davis and his top officials followed the developments in electricity futures , they would have realized the real nature of the risks facing consumers in the golden state . instead , they let a crisis develop , and then locked in long - term purchase contracts at all - time record - high prices just before they collapsed to normal levels .\nby some estimates , enron is on one side or the other of 25 per cent of all outstanding futures contracts in natural gas and electricity . since these contracts extend years ahead , and since the other parties to those trades are relying on enron ' s ability to cover its obligations , the risks to energy prices and supplies could be enormous if enron were to default .\nthat still seems extremely improbable . contracts executed through the public futures markets have the financial protection of those exchanges for enron ' s \" counterparties \" ( the term for the other side of a futures contract ) . but enron has enormous exposure through direct deals that have no such protection .\nwhat has hammered enron ' s securities lately is the unfolding story of gigantic off - balance - sheet deals the company made with partnerships that included , astonishingly enough , the chief financial officer , who was finally forced to go on leave . these partnership deals were never really disclosed , except in obscure balance sheet notes that gave no indication of the scale of the deals or that a senior company officer was involved .\nwhy should investors who aren ' t owners of enron stock or bonds care ? because the past year has seen the biggest swings in natural gas and electricity prices in history , and some observers wonder whether enron ' s internal problems exacerbated those swings . worse , if enron has to withdraw from the markets , what about the billions in forward hedging contracts that producers and consumers have in place ? many u . s . energy producers locked in high prices by making huge forward sales . if those contracts are voided , defaults could spread through the system , throwing energy markets into chaos .\nthere were enough problems in the energy - short u . s . even when enron was keeping the markets functioning . if the master market maker goes down , or is forced to curtail its operations , this winter could be a truly chilling experience for north americans . when bush and cheney aren ' t worrying about bin laden or anthrax , they may be worrying about enron .\ndonald coxe is chairman of harris investment management in chicago and toronto -

quarter loss widened marginally from $ 618 m to $ 635 m .\nin the securities and exchange commission filing , enron also announced the dismissal of two more officials : ben glisan , the company ' s treasurer , and kristina mordaunt , general counsel for one division .\nenron ran into trouble on october 16 , when it announced a $ 1 . 2 bn reduction of shareholders ' equity and a $ 1 . 01 bn charge .\nyesterday ' s filing goes some way to explaining how the charge came about . enron attributed the charge to dealings with ljm , a private equity fund run by andrew fastow , formerly enron chief financial officer .\nprivate equity investments have injected enormous volatility into the earnings of companies , such as jp morgan chase . keeping ljm off the balance sheet allowed enron to avoid major swings . but to prevent ljm being consolidated , enron had to own less than half of the special - purpose vehicle , and for outside investors to participate they had to be compensated .\nwhat that meant was that when the value of enron ' s private equity investments fell below a certain level , people familiar with enron ' s balance sheet said , co - investors would receive enron stock .\nthe enron filing reveals that the ljm losses arose from another group of special - purpose entities , known as the raptor vehicles , which were designed in part to hedge an enron investment in a bankrupt broadband company , rhythm netconnections .\nthe $ 1 . 2 bn reduction in shareholders ' equity arose from the termination of the raptor hedging arrangements , which if they had continued would have resulted in enron issuing 58 m shares to offset the company ' s private equity losses .\nenron also revealed that mr fastow was paid in excess of $ 30 m as a result of his role in running ljm .\nat issue is whether mr fastow was acting in the best interests of other enron shareholders .\nthe filing also raises questions about enron ' s cash flow , which will be studied carefully by the rating agencies and creditors .\na group of banks , including barclays bank , credit suisse first boston , deutsche bank , jp morgan chase and citigroup , have lent more than $ 4 bn to enron over the last weeks , much of it not collateralised .\nby reducing its earnings by more than $ 100 m for several years , enron has created concern about its ability to service debt . on the balance sheet , enron owes $ 12 . 8 bn . off - balance - sheet entities related to enron owe $ 8 bn - $ 9 bn . enron generates about $ 3 bn cashflow annually , but despite claiming to be cashflow - positive , its borrowings rose significantly last year .\n( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved .\nhttp : / / www . ft . com .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones super -

shareholder stocks and sold short the pro - management stocks could have captured that 8 . 5 per cent difference .\nthe study also found that the pro - management companies had lower sales growth and less profits than other firms in their industry .\nhowever , mr metrick stresses that the findings do not prove causation . strong management provisions do not necessarily undermine stock performance , nor do shareholder rights always lead to better returns .\n\" what we do know is that companies that gave shareholders rights did better than those that didn ' t in the 1990 s . . . so maybe if the companies that don ' t give shareholder rights gave them , their stock would do a lot better going forward , \" he said . \" maybe investors should be looking for that change . but that is the question the paper doesn ' t answer . \"\n( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved .\nhttp : / / www . ft . com .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones rather they have depended on ensuring that enron ' s risk managers are capable and organisationally independent of the traders they supervise . the agencies also looked over the risk management and valuation methodology and have found that it is the standard package for trading firms .\nthe problem is that enron ' s business is not the standard trading business . all conventional methodology , such as the various value - at - risk systems , or jp morgan ' s riskmetrics , assumes liquid , continuous markets , where it is possible to measure historic price volatility and implied price volatility . but the over - the - counter gas and electricity markets that are enron ' s core business involve long - term contracts , lumpy regional sub - markets , and unstable volatility measures . as one top wall street derivatives manager says \" these require scenario analyses rather than var . \"\nthe valuation problem is complicated by enron ' s gigantic market share , far larger than the largest institutions have in the government bond , currency , or exchange traded commodities markets .\neven so , it is likely that enron ' s long and short positions do balance , as the company says , even though the revenue recognition and profitability may need tuning . the company ' s earnings and balance sheet restatement was reassuring , in that there was no restatement of the balance sheet or income statement in the trading business . dynegy ' s due diligence team and the arthur anderson auditors working on enron ' s books know they had better get it right .\nif dynegy had announced a package of asset purchases rather than a stock deal , you could have wondered whether they saw value in enron as a going concern . that means keeping the trading business going , although probably running it more carefully and transparently . also , this is probably a \" once in a corporate lifetime \" opportunity to put together a merger of such large companies with the likely quick approval of antitrust regulators . there was no chance that the federal reserve or any other government entity would or could step in to assume responsibility for liquidity in the traded energy markets . the fed ' s giving a pass on antitrust considerations is a low - cost way to head off any problem .\nand enron ' s pipelines , gas storage business , power plants , liquefied natural gas facilities , and other physical assets would be difficult to duplicate . they would sell for a significant premium to the book value on which the bondholders have first call .\nso enron ' s $ 13 bn of debt is most likely a good buy , and you are getting it at close to bankruptcy prices . it is probably a good idea to leave the bet on the takeover price of the equity to the professional risk arbs .\n( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved .\nhttp : / / www . ft . com .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nenron in crisis -

which helped raise the company ' s recent third - quarter earnings 22 per cent to $ 286 m - is seen as a good fit with enron online . the two platforms allow customers to buy wholesale gas liquids at the click of a mouse .\nthere are other links . chuck watson , dynegy chief executive , is a friend of jeff skilling , who quit as enron chief executive officer in august . dynegy is also an important trading partner for enron , demonstrated by the fact that enron has helped bail out its new suitor in the past from potential trading losses .\nthat counterparty relationship may give dynegy a powerful incentive to preserve enron in order to maintain stability in the energy markets . analysts say there would be a big shake - up in the energy markets were enron to fail , although some say the volatility may be only short term . a takeover would not be the only way for rivals such as dynegy to capitalise on enron ' s weakness , however . dynegy , el paso and duke energy are already assessing potential opportunities to pick up enron ' s share of the market should it disappear . many are trading partners with enron , and some , like aquila , have been reducing their exposure as counterparties as the enron crisis deepens .\nhowever , any dynegy takeover of enron would invite close regulatory scrutiny . most analysts believe a deal could be done , but approval could take more than a year due to market issues and the complexity of the two companies .\nsome analysts said a deal might be perceived as a necessary bail -

simmering questions about its transparency .\nanalysts had long advised investors to look past those questions . after all , with the launch of enron ' s online platform in 1999 , trading volumes had soared as the number of products traded over the internet grew to almost 2 , 000 , ranging from weather derivatives to coal . enron ' s revenue more than doubled to $ 101 bn from 1999 to 2000 .\nmany admitted they were unsure how enron made its money . not only had the company so dramatically transformed itself from a traditional pipeline company but it had moved increasingly into unsupervised areas that made it harder to scrutinise enron ' s finances .\n\" it became a new age holding company , \" says paul kedrosky , who teaches strategy and corporate governance at the university of british columbia . \" as long as the company performed , people were willing to forgive what was obviously horrific disclosure . \"\nthose people included not only share market investors but also those in the business of buying and selling energy commodities . they needed goods and enron delivered more natural gas and electricity than anyone else , often at better prices . it was the first stop for utilities who lacked sufficient generation facilities to keep the lights on for their customers .\nthey would go to the open market and purchase electricity , much of the time from enron . those that use natural gas to power their generation facilities obtained that through the open market as well . many have locked themselves into long - term contracts with enron that they cannot get out of - and they would be the ones with most to lose if enron went under .\nbut those who were originally most spooked by the prospect of business without enron - the energy traders - seem to have accepted the reality that enron will most likely never dominate the markets as it had in the past .\nanalysts and traders say the trading markets themselves have remained stable throughout enron ' s troubles even as the risk of uncertainty has increased . \" no one knows their positions or how they ' re hedged in the market , or how they might have to cover their positions , \" one energy trader said yesterday .\neven though enron had been hailed as the innovator in building these markets to their current state of sophistication , it has been forced over the past few weeks to act increasingly like a newcomer .\nhowever , analysts say some of enron ' s partners in the us and europe are demanding enron provide evidence of the availability of cash or security that can be called on quickly .\nenron ' s main competitors are now able offer better prices , and - while still not openly seeking to undermine enron - are undercutting its business as they report new customers and higher volumes . but , so far , no major counter - party has changed its terms with the company . \" out of respect for enron ' s presence , my sense is the industry has tried to give them the benefit of the doubt to see if they can resolve this situation , \" says michael zimmer , of law firm baker & mckenzie . see lex .\n( c ) copyright financial times ltd . all rights reserved .\nhttp : / / www . ft . com .\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\nfront page -

rating firm . that debt is to investors who purchased assets from enron , including a water system in britain and other holdings .\nif enron ' s bond rating crashes , the assets presumably would be sold and enron would have to make up any remaining obligation to debt holders by delivering its stock to the partnerships , pellechia said . given the drop in enron ' s stock price , that might not be possible .\n\" we don ' t believe the asset value that supports those partnership trusts at this point in time is fully adequate to pay down the debt , \" he said .\n\" obviously there are a lot of options they [ enron officials ] are exploring . we are watching it very closely . \"\nhttp : / / www . washingtonpost . com\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones in return , enron took a note receivable , or simply a loan , from raptor for $ 1 . 2 billion .\nas it happened , enron benefited massively from the assets hedge . it protected itself against a $ 500 million decline in the assets in 2000 and $ 453 million in 2001 . these hedging gains were netted out to zero in enron core earnings , because they were offset by declines in asset values . but without the hedges , enron would ' ve taken the losses in its expense line .\nvince carter\nof course , the problem was that raptor , and therefore ljm 2 , was losing from the hedges . that might ' ve been tolerable if raptor were making money from the stock agreement . but enron ' s stock began falling sharply in 2001 , depriving ljm 2 of potential profits . meanwhile , as the stock price slid , enron was having to agree to issue more stock to keep the equity pledge to raptor at $ 1 . 2 billion . as the decline continued into the third quarter , and the issuance commitment grew , it made sense to unwind all the raptor deals with ljm 2 .\nat this point , enron took the $ 1 . 2 billion charge to equity in the third quarter to reverse the equity pledge . enron did take some of raptor ' s hedging losses itself , but it did so through a $ 711 million pretax charge , which it chose to exclude from operating earnings in the third quarter .\nthe big question is whether ljm 2 actually took any losses itself from raptor . why is that crucial ? if enron shielded ljm 2 from losses , it was essentially dealing with itself . the sec and investors wouldn ' t like that . what clues are there that ljm 2 didn ' t take a loss ? well , the thursday press release says that enron bought out ljm 2 ' s stakes in raptor for $ 35 million . that makes little sense . how can ljm 2 have had any raptor equity left after the losses it appears to have sustained ? if enron made ljm 2 whole , then this was all little more than a shell game .\nseems like enron still has a whole lot more to tell us .\nworld stock markets -

billion ( u . s . ) drop in shareholder equity after the company terminated complex share transactions with certain limited partnerships . the dealings had enabled enron to grow dramatically without having to show a huge whack of debt on its balance sheet , which would have affected its ability to raise capital and hampered its rapid transformation from regional gas pipeline utility to global energy - trading powerhouse .\nsuch transactions are common and practical . but enron ' s were unusually complicated , and the company was roundly assailed for keeping the details to itself .\ndisclosure has never been this company ' s middle name . the former ceo once used a seven - letter expletive to describe an analyst who had the temerity to ask for a balance sheet during an earnings conference call . but the real stunner was that , unknown to the investing public but with the board ' s apparent approval , two partnerships had been set up , to considerable personal profit , by enron ' s own chief financial officer , andrew faston . he walked the plank on oct . 24 , and the company has been scrambling ever since .\nopaque accounting doesn ' t necessarily mean there is any skullduggery afoot . the finances of some companies are devilishly complicated , simply because of the nature of their businesses . and that goes for enron and its massive energy - trading and hedging operations .\nbut investors should always be looking for as much financial visibility as possible and steering clear of any company that cannot - - or will not - - provide it . bmilner @ globeandmail . ca\ncopyright ? 2000 dow jones & company , inc . all rights reserved .\ncity -

that ` s always bad news when you ` ve got to restate for that far back .\nkatayama : and it always hangs on a stock . you remember it happened to cendant ( url : http : / / www . cendant . com / ) . you remember it happened to sunbeam ( url : http : / / www . sunbeam . com / ) . the thing is , it ` s probably going to unravel over weeks and it ` s not going to be any time soon and that may also mean any deal may be dragged down . that ` s a problem , because what are enron ` s assets ?
